                    "_content": "Before heavy industry moved in to the Coastal Bend, cotton was king and farm commodities were the predominate exports of the Port of Corpus Christi. Beginning in the 1930s, the fossil fuel industry began moving into the area, and it has grown dramatically since. Promising job and economic growth, it brought enormous environmental consequences to the area, with increasing emissions and discharge that continue to infringe on neighborhoods and degrade ecosystems. In the last five years, massive buildout has brought in ever-expanding plastics and steel manufacturing sites, and pipelines from the Permian Basin that transport crude to expanding tank farms and marine terminals - all with the blessings of local economic development corporations, government, and the increasingly authoritarian Port of Corpus Christi Authority. Channels of Life takes a look at what is already here and what is to come. Whether you are pleasure-boating in the channels or driving down the highway, you only see the edge of industrial sprawl that already exists. The depth of the incursion is not visible from ground level. Flying from Port Aransas, up the La Quinta Channel, to the Nueces Delta and ending at Refinery Row, this album offers a bird\u2019s eye view of what we have now, and what is on the horizon.  It begs the questions, how much more industrial saturation can the Coastal Bend\u2019s public health and ecosystem withstand before it is all sacrificed? Is it destined to become a sacrifice zone for increasing corporate wealth and prestige? "

But, mine tunnels can collapse and lead to acidic water draining from abandoned underground mines into soil and groundwater. Methane gas in coal deposits can explode if it concentrates in underground mines. This coalbed methane must be vented out of mines to make mines safer places to work. According to the Energy Information Administration, &quot;in 2017, methane emissions from coal mining and abandoned coal mines accounted for about 9% of total US methane emissions, and nearly 1% of total US greenhouse gas emissions (based on global warming potential).&quot; Several emissions result from coal combustion, including sulfur dioxide, particulates, carbon dioxide, ashes, and mercury and other heavy metals. These photos illustrate the buildout and of coal mining facilities, infrastructure and activities - and the environmental degradation that comes with it - in various locations around the US."

Ethane crackers plants perform the first step in the transformation process, separating ethane \u2013 a component of natural gas\u2014into ethylene, the building block of plastics and other industrial products. They use extreme heat to 'crack' the molecular bonds in ethane to produce this material. Ethylene is a critical building block for the petrochemical industry, and is among the most produced organic compounds. Ethane crackers depend on natural gas for their ethane supply, and these plants also use natural gas to generate electricity. Plus, building more ethane cracker plants necessitates increased construction of fracking infrastructure, all of which slows down the transition to renewable energy. These photos illustrate the buildout of infrastructure and transportation lines that the oil, gas, and petrochemical industry utilizes to transform resources into petrochemicals and plastics. "

Flaring is a combustion process that burns off associated, unwanted, or excess gases and liquids released during normal or unplanned over-pressuring operations in many industrial processes, such as extraction, refinement, chemical plants and coal industry operations, and waste disposal at landfills.

They make up toiletries, electronics, building materials, and synthetic fertilizers that grow our food. The most ubiquitous use of petrochemicals, however, is to make plastic. Petrochemicals are often left out of the global discussion on energy, but they are a rapidly expanding part of the fossil fuel industry. Companies are taking advantage of cheap shale gas and investing heavily into petrochemicals, particularly plastics - the fastest-growing group of bulk materials in the world. This boom in the petrochemical industry is coming at a point of increasing global awareness of the disaster that is plastic pollution. As much as 12.7 million tons of plastic waste goes into the ocean each year. In response to this crisis, hundreds of cities and many countries are instituting policies to reduce plastic consumption. The photos in this album depict the buildout of infrastructure and activities of the process by which oil, gas, and petrochemical materials are processed and transformed into plastics. The photos were captured in various locations around the US."

Fossil fuel power stations convert heat energy of combustion into mechanical energy, which then powers an electrical generator.  These power plants contribute to the climate crisis because they produce emissions - like methane - degrade environments and air and water quality, and contribute to ocean acidification. These photos illustrate the buildout of power plant infrastructure in various locations around the US."

                    "_content": "Lycoming Ceek is a 37.5-mile-long tributary of the West Branch Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania. Located in Tioga, Lycoming, and Sullivan counties, its watershed is heavily forested (over 80% forest cover) and includes both state forest and state game lands. Exceptional value and high quality designations characterize much of the creek and its tributaries. These waters are home to stocked and wild trout populations as well as the eastern hellbender, the state amphibian.\n \nDespite a small human population (~20,000), the 272 square mile basin is under pressure from extensive natural gas development and companion activities, like water withdrawals. At least, 572 gas wells have been proposed in the watershed and 370 drilled. More than a dozen compressor stations and other gas-related facilities are found here plus miles of pipeline.\n \nAn important tributary to Lycoming Creek, is legendary Rock Run, considered by many to be one of the most beautiful streams in the Commonwealth. Rock Run drains a section of the Loyalsock State Forest, including the Clarence Moore lands, a sizeable area within the state forest with severed mineral rights. This relatively pristine landscape was at risk of seeing large-scale gas development with up to 19 well pads under consideration. Thanks to the work of the Foundation for Pennsylvania Watersheds, the formation of a Save PA Forests Coalition, and much education and advocacy, eventually the immediate threat of gas buildout diminished. While the urgency has waned, the bogs, wetlands, beech-birch-maple forests , and crystalline waters remain vulnerable to future drilling whims.\n \nMeanwhile, drilling on nearby public and private lands pose their own impacts to the encompassing, yet still fragile, Lycoming Creek watershed."

                    "_content": "Wind energy refers to the creation of electricity using wind or air flows that occur naturally in the atmosphere. Modern wind turbines are used to capture kinetic energy from the wind and generate electricity. Postively, wind is a clean, renewable energy source, and is one of the most cost-effective sources for electricity. On the downside, wind turbines can be noisy and unappealing aesthetically, and can sometimes adversely impact the physical environment around them. However, the long-term carbon footprint of wind turbines is far less than fossil fuel energy production. These photos illustrate advances in wind energy utilization in various locations around the US."
